In winter, slippery road conditions such as snowy, icy, or slushy pavement, are the major threat to road safety. A CV-based slippery pavement detection system was proposed in this study, where the data of vehicles are used to provide real-time coverage of the pavement slippery conditions in the complete road network. 

The system utilizes the data from part 1 of the BSM, which is easy to deploy in the filed. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is used to process data and provide feedback on pavement conditions. The process of detection can be automatically implemented. Real-time warnings of pavement slippery conditions can alert drivers to prevent accidents.
